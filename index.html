       <p class=" text-center ">Artistry refers to the ability to create art. Face painting has given

        the ability of transforming quiet, reserved kids into confident livewires in a matter of minutes
        – and that is a powerful thing. Students did not just paint faces but have expressed their
        
        emotions through these art pieces.
        
        We, at The Class of One conducted the “Face Painting Competition” to encourage students to
        express their love for art and creativity. We ensured maximum participation and the children
        got deeply engaged which helped in developing their cognitive, social-emotional, and
        
        multisensory skills.
        
        All students have created fantastic art pieces, but we must appreciate the masterwork. The
        listed students went out of the box with their imagination and worked meticulously on their
        
        design and innovated Chef-D’oeuvre.

Our tiny tots created the magical essence of the Tale World during this competition which gave us goosebumps. It was a delightful experience to see their deep understanding and confident narrations during the competition.

           <p class="text-center">Listening to stories is edutainment and narrating them is an art!

            We thus, spare no opportunity to usher our children to engage with stories, to prompt new
            wonder in them even whilst helping exercise their tender imaginations. In continuation of this
            endeavour we, at The Class of One conducted the “Story telling competition” to encourage
            students to be expressive imaginative and confident. We ensured maximum participation and
            the children got deeply engaged which helped in developing their cognitive, social-emotional,
            
            and oratory skills.
            
            All students narrated the story in their own unique way, but presentation skills of few
            students were outstanding. The listed students went out of the box with their imagination and
            
            worked meticulously on their presentation.</p>

        <p class=" text-center ">“Manpower without unity is not a strength unless it is harmonised and united properly,
          then it becomes a spiritual power.” The children came together and created beautiful posters to showcase the
          real meaning of the day. They returned with a valuable lesson after the competition - ‘Unity is Strength.
